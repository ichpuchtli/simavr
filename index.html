        <h1>simavr - a lean and mean Atmel AVR simulator for linux</h1>

<p><em>simavr</em> is a new AVR simulator for linux, or any platform that uses avr-gcc. It uses 
avr-gcc's own register definition to simplify creating new targets for supported AVR
devices. The core was made to be small and compact, and hackable so allow quick 
prototyping of an AVR project. The AVR core is now stable for use with parts 
with &lt;= 128KB flash, and with preliminary support for the bigger parts. The 
simulator loads ELF files directly, and there is even a way to specify simulation 
parameters directly in the emulated code using an .elf section. You can also 
load multipart HEX files.</p>

<h2>Supported IOs</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>eeprom</em></li>
<li><em>watchdog</em></li>
<li>
<em>IO ports</em> (including pin interrupts)</li>
<li>
<em>Timers</em>, 8 &amp;16 (Normal, CTC and Fast PWM, the overflow interrupt too)</li>
<li>The <em>UART</em>, including tx &amp; rx interrupts (there is a loopback/local echo test mode too)</li>
<li>
<em>SPI</em>, master/slave including the interrupt</li>
<li>
<em>i2c</em> Master &amp; Slave</li>
<li>External <em>Interrupts</em>, INT0 and so on.</li>
<li><em>ADC</em></li>
<li>Self-programming (ie bootloaders!)</li>
</ul><h2>Emulated Cores (very easy to add new ones!)</h2>

<ul>
<li>AT90USB162 (with USB!)</li>
<li>ATMega1280</li>
<li>ATMega128</li>
<li>ATMega16M1</li>
<li>ATMega164/324/644</li>
<li>ATMega48/88/168/328</li>
<li>ATMega8</li>
<li>ATTiny25/45/85</li>
<li>ATTIny44/84</li>
<li>ATTiny2313</li>
<li>ATTiny13</li>
</ul><h2>Extras:</h2>

<ul>
<li>fully working <em>gdb</em> support including some pretty cool “passive modes”.</li>
<li>There is also very easy support for “VCD” (Value Change Dump) that can be visualized 
graphically as “waveforms” with tools like <em>gtkwave</em> (see below).</li>
<li>There are a few examples of real life firmwares running on simavr, including OpenGL rendering of the display…</li>
<li>There is support for <em>Arduino</em>, but no IDE integration</li>
</ul><p><em>Note:</em> a mailing list/google group now exists
You can also join <em>#simavr</em> on Freenode for a very quiet IRC channel.</p>

<h2>VCD Support -- built in logic analyzer </h2>

<p><em>simavr</em> can output most of its pins, firmware variables, interrupts and a few other
things as signals to be dumped into a file that can be plotted using gtkwave for
further, precise analysis.
A firmware can contain instructions for <em>simavr</em> to know what to trace, and the file is
automatically generated.
Example:</p>

<pre><code>const struct avr_mmcu_vcd_trace_t _mytrace[]  _MMCU_ = {
    { AVR_MCU_VCD_SYMBOL("UDR0"), .what = (void*)&amp;UDR0, },
    { AVR_MCU_VCD_SYMBOL("UDRE0"), .mask = (1 &lt;&lt; UDRE0), .what = (void*)&amp;UCSR0A, },
};
</code></pre>

<p>Will tell <em>simavr</em> to generate a trace everytime the UDR0 register changes and everytime
the interrupt is raised (in UCSR0A). The <em><em>MMCU</em></em> tag tells gcc that it needs compiling,
but it won't be linked in your program, so it takes literally zero bytes, this is a code
section that is private to <em>simavr</em>, it's free!
A program running with these instructions and writing to the serial port will generate
a file that will display:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./simavr/run_avr tests/atmega88_example.axf
AVR_MMCU_TAG_VCD_TRACE 00c6:00 - UDR0
AVR_MMCU_TAG_VCD_TRACE 00c0:20 - UDRE0
Loaded 1780 .text
Loaded 114 .data
Loaded 4 .eeprom
Starting atmega88 - flashend 1fff ramend 04ff e2end 01ff
atmega88 init
avr_eeprom_ioctl: AVR_IOCTL_EEPROM_SET Loaded 4 at offset 0
Creating VCD trace file 'gtkwave_trace.vcd'
Read from eeprom 0xdeadbeef -- should be 0xdeadbeef..
Read from eeprom 0xcafef00d -- should be 0xcafef00d..
simavr: sleeping with interrupts off, quitting gracefully
</code></pre>

<p>And when the file is loaded in gtkwave, you see:

<p>You get a very precise timing breakdown of any change that you add to the trace, down
to the AVR cycle. </p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p><em>simavr</em> is really made to be the center for emulating your own AVR projects, not just
a debugger, but also the emulating the peripherals you will use in your firmware, so 
you can test and develop offline, and now and then try it on the hardware.</p>

<p>You can also use <em>simavr</em> to do test units on your shipping firmware to validate it
before you ship a new version, to prevent regressions or mistakes.</p>

<p><em>simavr</em> has a few 'complete projects/ that demonstrate this, most of them were made
using real hardware at some point, and the firmware binary is <em>exactly</em> the one that
ran on the hardware. The key here is to emulate the <em>parts</em> or peripherals that
are hooked to the AVR. Of course, you don't have to emulate the full hardware, you just
need to generate the proper stimulus so that the AVR is fooled.</p>

<h2>HD44780 LCD Board Demo</h2>

<p><img src="https://github.com/buserror-uk/simavr/raw/master/doc/img/hd44780.png" alt="lcd"></p>

<p>This example board hooks up an Atmega48 to an emulated HD44780 LCD and display a running
counter in the 'lcd'. Everything is emulated, the firmware runs exactly like this
on a real hardware.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/buserror-uk/simavr/raw/master/doc/img/hd44780-wave.png" alt="lcd-gtkwave"></p>

<p>And this is a gtkwave trace of what the firmware is doing. You can zoom in, measure, etc
in gtkwave, select trades to see etc.</p>

<p>Quite a few other examples are available!</p>
